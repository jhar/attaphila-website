# Attaphila website

Looks to essentially be a blog. Could be done with Wordpress and a traditional shared server, but I'm going to make my life difficult and write it from scratch with Node.js

## Original message from Zach

I might want you help in the future for a personal Zach the Biologist website, but the one I’m interested in creating now is going to a platform for the particular genus of cockroaches I’ve begun to study and plan on continuing to study.  There’s an old series of humor columns under the title of Archy and Mehitabel, issued back when newspapers carried all kinds of exciting surreal nonsense, about a cockroach that wrote free-verse poems about himself and a cat (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archy_and_Mehitabel).  I want this website to be a descendant of that column, in a way.  It’s about a real genus of cockroaches (Attaphila), but it will be from the cockroach’s perspective.  The following are a brainstorm of the “content areas” of the page I’m considering:

1. Scrapbook - where I can upload all manner of miscellany associated with Attaphila or cockroaches.  For instance, I had friends send me cartoons of what a cockroach living with an ant looks like.  I’d put these images in this section.  And links to weird cockroach related stuff.  So this is all the stuff I collect on cockroaches that I find interesting, but it’s part of Attaphila’s scrapbook.

2. Photo Album - pictures and videos of Attaphila.  Won’t be too many.

3. What the labcoats are saying - This is where I can upload scholarly articles on Attaphila and other related topics.

4.  Journal - this is the most direct conjuring of Archy and Mehitabel.  I will occasionally write weird stuff from the mouth of Attaphila (instead of a cat, he’ll have his fungus garden and associated ant colony as his companion).  Who knows what Attaphila will say.  I don’t.  It might make sense to turn this into a twitter account.

What do you think?  All of this very minimalist.  The main page clean, with central picture of Attaphila, and links to the other pages around it.  Actually, it could be an image of the cockroach in the center of the fungal garden (schematically drawn and stylized), and the links placed at four corners of the garden.

Have I sent you pics or video of the roach yet?
